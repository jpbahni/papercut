of educational courses or training programs. A tool to help instructors deliver materials to students, administer tests and other

universities that offer open and distance education. Interaction between teacher and student is in the form of a forum, chat, 

online quizzes and exams, video conferencing and more. Effectiveness of these pedagogical tools are measured via online or paper 

survey among end users.
 
Background and Statement of the Problem

learning strategy, and that teacher-centered classrooms may not be the be the most efficiently structured ones for student 

engagement.
 
Learning Management System came at the spur of web 2.0 in the 21st century. A system to manage learning, packaging up the whole 

messy business of teaching and learning into a collection of neat web pages. However, for this system to be effective, a stable 

telecommunication network must also be present. LMS’s relies so much on internet connectivity, to utilize this, the three major 

users namely the administrator, teacher and the student must also be online for them to interact.
 
The telco company in the country is played by duopoly (Globe and Smart) thus the price for going online is still high. From the 

country’s population, the percentage of not being online is greater by a mile. People engage in online learning or other 

activities that involves the internet has to go to a café and pay an hourly rate to check their inboxes, this process is repeated 

over and over and it kills precious time.
